# Login Page--

Simple static Login page built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Project overview

- Lightweight project demonstrating a login UI with client-side validation.
- No backend included — this is a front-end template for learning or prototyping.

**Files

- `index.html` : Main HTML file containing the login form and structure.
- `index.css` : Styles for the login page.
- `index.js` : Client-side JavaScript (form validation and interactions).

**Features

- Responsive form layout.
- Basic client-side validation (see `index.js`).
- Easy to customize and integrate with a backend.

**How to run (local)

- Option 1: Open directly in your browser

  - Double-click `index.html` or open it via your browser's File → Open.

- Option 2: Serve with a simple HTTP server (recommended for some browser APIs)
  - If you have Python installed, run in PowerShell from the project folder:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# or for Python 3 explicitly:
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Customizing**

- Edit `index.css` to change styles and layout.
- Edit `index.js` to change validation rules or integrate an API call to your backend.

**Contributing**

- This is a simple template — feel free to fork and adapt it.

**License**

- No license specified. Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to define reuse terms.

**Notes**

 This project is intended for frontend demonstration only; do not use client-side validation as your only security measure in production.
